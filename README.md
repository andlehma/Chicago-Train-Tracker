# Train Tracker

I re-created the CTA arrivals board in React.js using the [CTA Train Tracker API](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/ttdocs/)

By the way, I re-wrote this project in Angular just for fun. Check it out at [andlehma/angular-train-tracker](https://github.com/andlehma/angular-train-tracker)
